\worksheetbreak
Remember that this topic is massive. I could easily give a full
semester course on this stuff to really do it justice, so most of this
workshop is just me working through the material as I learn it.

\worksheetbreak
As a result, it is highly likely this worksheet and code contains
typos, errors, logical flaws and other mistakes in need of correction
in this workshop, so if you note any, please let me know so I can try
to fix them!

\worksheetsection{Introduction}

\noindent
A graph is a mathematical object that can be defined as a pair
$\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of \emph{vertices} or
\emph{nodes}, and $E$ is a set of \emph{edges} that joins two
vertices. Edges in general may be directed, undirected or
bidirected. They are typically visualised by using shapes or points
for the nodes and lines for the edges.

\worksheetbreak
The concept of \emph{conditional independence} is related to that of
\emph{statistical independence}. Suppose we have three random
variables $A$, $B$ and $C$, then $A$ and $B$ are
\emph{conditionally independent} given $C$, writen $A \perp B \, | \, C$,
iff, for every given value $c$ in $C$, $A$ and $B$ are independent
in the conditional distribution given $C = c$.

\worksheetbreak
Another way of saying this is that for some $f$ a generic density or
probability mass function, then one characteristic of $A \perp B \, | \, C$
is that

\[ f(a, b \, | \, c) = f(a \, | \, c) f(b \, | \, c). \]

\noindent
An equivalent characterisation is that the joint density of $A$, $B$
and $C$ factorises as

\[ f(a, b, c) = g(a, c) \, h(b, c). \]

\worksheetbreak
Finally, we will also make heavy use of Bayes' Rule, the standard
formula for relating conditional probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}. \]

\worksheetsection{The Sprinkler Network}

<<sprinkler_graph, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height='8cm'>>=
yn <- c("yes", "no");

sprinkler.cptlist <- compileCPT(list(
    cptable(~Rain,                        levels = yn, values = c(2, 8))
   ,cptable(~Sprinkler + Rain,            levels = yn, values = c(1, 99, 4, 6))
   ,cptable(~wetGrass + Rain + Sprinkler, levels = yn, values = c(99, 1, 8, 2, 9, 1, 0, 1))
    ));

sprinkler.grain <- grain(sprinkler.cptlist);

plot(sprinkler.grain);
@

\noindent
Two events can cause grass to be wet: Either the sprinkler is on or
it is raining. Rain has a direct effect on the use of the sprinkler
(namely that when it rains, the sprinkler is usually not turned on).

\worksheetbreak
This can be modeled with a Bayesian network. The variables
(R)ain, (S)prinkler, Wet(G)rass have two possible values: (y)es
and (n)o.

\worksheetbreak
We can factorise the joint probability mass function as

\[ p_{GSR}(g, s, r) = p_{G|SR}(g | s, r) p_{S|R}(s | r) p_R(r) \]

\noindent
or overloading the notation a little:

\[ P(G, S, R) = P(G | S, R) P(S, R) = P(G | S, R) P(S | R) P(R) \]

\noindent
This means we can construct the joint probability table by starting
with the \emph{conditional probability tables} (CPTs).

\worksheetexercise Create the 3 CPTs using the \texttt{parray}
function and the following conditional probabilities:

\begin{align*}
  P(R)           &= 0.2 \\
  P(S|R)         &= 0.01 & P(S|\neg R)         &= 0.4\\
  P(G|S,R)       &= 0.99 & P(G|S, \neg R)      &= 0.9 & P(G|\neg S, R) &= 0.8  & P(G|\neg S, \neg R) &= 0
\end{align*}

\worksheetexercise Calculate the full joint probability function
$P(G, S, R)$. \emph{HINT:} The function \texttt{tabListMult()} might
be of use.

\worksheetexercise Calculate the probability that it is raining given
that the grass is wet. \emph{HINT:} The functions \texttt{tabMarg()}
and \texttt{tabDiv()} may be of use.

\worksheetsection{Genetic Inheritance}

\noindent
We now turn our attention to analysing genetic inheritance on the
chromosomes for a given DNA sequence.

\worksheetbreak
An \emph{allele} is the DNA sequence at a marker and can take two
values marked $A$ or $B$ (in practice there can be 10 or 20 different
values).

\worksheetbreak
A \emph{genotype} is an unordered pair of alleles: $AA$, $AB$, or
$BB$.

\worksheetbreak
The genotype of a person at a specific marker is a random variable
with state space $\{AA, AB, BA\}$.

\worksheetbreak
We are interested in the joint distribution of genotypes for a group
of people.

<<genetics_graph, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm', out.height='6cm'>>=
ab <- c("A", "B");

genetics.cptlist <- compileCPT(list(
    cptable(~father,                  levels = ab, values = c(1, 1))
   ,cptable(~mother,                  levels = ab, values = c(1, 1))
   ,cptable(~child + mother + father, levels = ab, values = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
    ));

genetics.grain <- grain(genetics.cptlist);

plot(genetics.grain);
@


\worksheetbreak
A child inherits one allele from each parent independently.

\worksheetbreak
The parentâ€™s two alleles have equal probability of being passed on to
the child.

\worksheetbreak
Each combination has probability $0.25$; some lead to the same
genotype for the child.

<<genotype_table, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results='show', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, size='normalsize'>>=
gts <- c("AA", "AB", "BB");

prob <- function(child, mother, father) {
    child  <- strsplit(child,  "")[[1]];
    mother <- strsplit(mother, "")[[1]];
    father <- strsplit(father, "")[[1]];

    ## Probability of inheriting allele a from genotype gt
    P <- function(a, gt) ((a == gt[1]) + (a == gt[2])) / 2;

    if(child[1] != child[2]) {
        P(child[1], mother) * P(child[2], father) + P(child[1], father) * P(child[2], mother)
    } else {
        P(child[1], mother) * P(child[2], father)
    }
}


dt_tab <- CJ(child = gts, mother = gts, father = gts);
dt_tab <- dt_tab[, prob := mapply(prob, child, mother, father)];

print(dcast(dt_tab, child ~ father + mother, value.var = 'prob'));

@

\noindent
So in this case we have the the joint probability distribution as
being

\[ p(m, f, c) = p(m) \, p(f) \, p(c \, | \, m, f) \]

\worksheetexercise Assuming the population frequency of alleles $A$
and $B$ is $0.3$ and $0.7$ respectively, calculate the distribution of
the genotypes. \emph{HINT:} You probably want to work with the
binomial distribution for this, \texttt{dbinom()}.

\worksheetexercise Construct the probability tables for the three
nodes in the chart. \emph{HINT:} Look at the function
\texttt{cptable()} for this.

\worksheetexercise Build the Bayesian network and plot it out.

\worksheetexercise What is the marginal distribution of the father's
genotype?

\worksheetexercise What is the joint distribution of mother and child?

\worksheetexercise What is the conditional joint distribution of the
father, given values for mother and child?

\worksheetexercise A mother with a genotype $BB$ has a child with
genotype $AB$. Given that a man has genotype $AB$, how can we
determine if the man is likely to be the child's father?

\worksheetexercise Construct the Bayesian network as seen below.

<<genetics_graph_grandparents, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm', out.height='8cm'>>=

extended.genetic.family.cptlist <- compileCPT(list(
    cptable(~grandfather,                        levels = ab, values = c(1, 1))
   ,cptable(~grandmother,                        levels = ab, values = c(1, 1))
   ,cptable(~mother,                             levels = ab, values = c(1, 1))
   ,cptable(~father + grandfather + grandmother, levels = ab, values = rep(1, 8))
   ,cptable(~uncle + grandfather + grandmother,  levels = ab, values = rep(1, 8))
   ,cptable(~child + mother + father,            levels = ab, values = rep(1, 8))
    ));

extended.genetic.family.grain <- grain(extended.genetic.family.cptlist);

plot(extended.genetic.family.grain);
@

\worksheetexercise Suppose the `father' is not willing to give a
sample but his brother is, and tests $AA$. What is the probability of
observing this evidence if the man is in fact the father?


\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{The Chest Clinic Example}

\noindent
We now move up to a bigger example, the Chest Clinic example as
discussed in Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter (1988):

\begin{quote}
Shortness-of-breath (dyspnoea) may be due to tuberculosis, lung cancer
or bronchitis, or none of them, or more than one of them. A recent
visit to Asia increases the chances of tuberculosis, while smoking is
known to be a risk factor for both lung cancer and bronchitis.  The
results of a single chest X-ray do not discriminate between lung
cancer and tuberculosis, as neither does the presence or absence of
dyspnoea.
\end{quote}

\worksheetexercise Breaking down the above paragraph into discrete
facts, construct a network graph that captures the relationships
described.

\worksheetexercise Load the dataset \texttt{chestSim500} and create
the Bayesian network using this data. What is the unconditional
probability of an individual having lung cancer according to this
network?

\worksheetexercise Given that we know the individual has visited Asia
and has dyspnoea, what is the conditional probability now that the
person has lung cancer?

\worksheetexercise Repeat the above process using the dataset
\texttt{chestSim1000}. How much do the probabilities change?

\worksheetexercise Repeat the above process using the datasets for all
the simulated data in the \texttt{gRbase} package. Does this have much
of an effect on the outputted probabilities? \emph{HINT:} Use the R
command \texttt{data()} to find all available datasets from a package.

\worksheetexercise Given the above datasets, what is the marginal
probabilities of the three diseases mentioned above? (Lung cancer,
Tuberculosis and Dyspnoea)


\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Scaling the Networks}

\noindent
All of the above approaches are example of the `Brute Force' approach
which is done by calculating the full joint distribution for the
network $p(V)$ as a multiple of the CPTs that comprise it.


\[ p(V) = p(a) \, p(t|a) \, p(s) \, p(l|s) \, p(b|s) \, p(e|t, l) \, p(d|e, b) \, p(x|e) \]

\noindent
This gives $p(V)$ represented by a table with $2^8 = 256$ entries.

\worksheetbreak
We can then marginalise and condition as desired to calculate whatever
probabilities we need.

\worksheetbreak
This scales appalling badly. A network with 80 variables, each with 10
values has a joint probability space of $10^{80}$, approximately the
count of atoms in the universe.

\worksheetbreak
\begin{center}
We are going to need a bigger boat...
\end{center}

\worksheetbreak
So, we need a way to not need the full joint distribution, instead
focusing on the the low dimensional CPTs and send `messages' between
them.

\worksheetbreak
To use a network it first needs to be \emph{compiled} and then
\emph{propagated}. Compilation of a network based on CPTs is first
\emph{moralised} --- edges are added between the parents of each node,
and then directed edges are replaced with undirected ones. It is then
\emph{triangulated} to form a triangulated graph.

\worksheetbreak
The CPTs are transformed into \emph{clique potentials} defined on the
cliques of the chordal graph.

\worksheetbreak
We can see this process below:

<<chestclinic_compile_process, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE, results='show', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm', out.height='8cm'>>=

chestclinic.dag <- dag(list(
    "asia"
   ,c("tub", "asia")
   ,"smoke"
   ,c("lung", "smoke")
   ,c("bronc", "smoke")
   ,c("either", "lung", "tub")
   ,c("xray", "either")
   ,c("dysp", "bronc", "either")
    ));


chestclinic.moralized    <- moralize(chestclinic.dag);
chestclinic.triangulated <- triangulate(chestclinic.moralized);

iplot(chestclinic.triangulated);
@

\noindent
Once we have this DAG created, we also want to see how the
triangulated data looks as a junction tree. The messages passed
between connected nodes on the graph involve the common variables in
the nodes, and propagating the information just involves a double pass
down and up the tree.

<<chestclinic_rip_plot, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results='show', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm', out.height='8cm'>>=
chestclinic.rip <- rip(chestclinic.triangulated);

chestclinic.rip

plot(rip(chestclinic.triangulated));
@

\worksheetexercise Create the \texttt{grain} object from the
\texttt{chestSim500} data.

\worksheetexercise Find the marginal, joint and conditional
probability for lung cancer and bronchitis given that the person
recently visited Asia and displayed symptoms of dyspnoea

\worksheetexercise Suppress the automatic propagation of the data and
redo the code, but this time adding the evidence one piece at a time.
