\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Conditional Probability}

\noindent
Suppose that in the general population, the probability of having a
specific rare disease (the Dreaded Lurgy) is one in a thousand. We
denote the true presence or absence of the disease as the value of a
parameter, $\theta$, that can have the value 1 if disease is present,
or the value 0 if the disease is absent. The base rate of the disease
is therefore denoted $p(\theta = 1) = 0.001$. This is our prior belief
that a person selected at random has the disease.

\worksheetbreak
Suppose that there is a test for the disease that has a 99\% hit rate,
which means that if a person has the disease, then the test result is
positive 99\% of the time. We denote a positive test result as $D = 1$,
and a negative test result as $D = 0$. The observed test result is
a bit of data that we will use to modify our belief about the value of
the underlying disease parameter. The hit rate is expressed as
$p(D = 1 \, | \, \theta = 1) = 0.99$.

\worksheetbreak
The test also has a false alarm rate of 5\%. This means that 5\% of
the time when the disease is not present, the test falsely indicates
that the disease is present. Wedenote the false alarm rate as
$p(D = 1 \, | \, \theta = 0) = 0.05$.

\worksheetbreak
However, what we need to know is $p(\theta = 1 \, | \, D = 1)$, i.e. the
probability that the patient has the disease given a positive test
result.

\worksheetbreak
We can calculate the above conditional probability given Bayes' Rule
and using arithmetic and algebra. Somewhat counter-intuitively, we
calculate a probability slightly below 2\%.

\worksheetbreak
We will try to estimate this probability using simulation.



\worksheetexercise The supplied function
\texttt{generate.disease.test.data()} generates sample data based on
the above numbers. Look at the function definition to see how it is
used, and generate some sample data, then use this data to estimate
the conditional probability. with a reasonable number of datapoints
(say 1,000,000) you should get an estimate close to the analytic
answer.


\worksheetexercise Why is this conditional probability so low?
Experiment with the dependency of this probability on the three input
probabilities. (Any plotting system will work, though I will use
ggplot2 for mine)


\worksheetexercise How are the probabilities changed if two
independant tests are tried? The provided function
\texttt{generate.disease.twotest.data()} generates random data for
this. Using this function, calculate the conditional probabilities of
having the disease, given the various combinations of test results.

\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Analytical Approach}

\noindent
Bayesian reasoning is as old as the concept of probabilities, but has
only recently started to receive a lot of attention. One likely reason
for this is that, apart from a few special cases, it is mot possible
to perform the calculations analytically.

\worksheetbreak In our application we have a prior distribution for
our beliefs, $p(\theta)$, and a likelihood for the data,
$p(D | \theta)$, and through use of the Chain Rule, we get the
posterior distribution, $p(\theta | D)$,

\[ p(\theta | D) = \int d\theta \, p(D | \theta) \, p(\theta).  \]

\worksheetbreak
In those special cases, the likelihood function has a prior and
posterior distribution with the same functional form, i.e. the prior
and the posterior are two members of the same `family' of functions.

\worksheetbreak
For the rest of this workshop we are going to deal with estimating the
fairness of a coin, based on the result of multiple coin tosses. We
define `success' as the toss coming up Heads, and denote this
probability as $\theta$. Thus,

\[ P(y = 1 | \, \theta) = \theta \; \text{ and } \;
   P(y = 0 | \, \theta) = 1 - \theta. \]

\worksheetbreak
We can combine the above two into a single expression:

\[ P(y | \theta) = \theta^y (1 - \theta)^{(1 - y)} \].

\worksheetbreak
Now we consider the data $y$ to be fixed, and consider the above as a
function of $\theta$. With this approach we call the above equation
\emph{the likelihood function of $\theta$}.

\worksheetbreak The Bernoulli function has a conjugate prior: the
\emph{Beta distribution}, $\text{Beta}(a, b)$. R supports the beta
distribution natively, via the standard grouping of functions for
probability distributions: \texttt{rbeta()}, \texttt{dbeta()},
\texttt{pbeta()}, \texttt{qbeta()}.


\worksheetexercise Plot the density distribution for the Beta
distribution using various combinations of parameters $a$ and $b$.


\worksheetexercise Load the data in \texttt{cointoss10}, and use it
and the beta distribution to investigate the effect of the prior on
the posterior distribution.


\worksheetexercise Load the data in \texttt{cointoss1000}, and use it
and the same priors used in the previous exercise to investigate the
effect of the prior on the posterior distribution.


\worksheetexercise Compare the posterior distributions for the same
priors using the two datasets. How do they compare, and why do you
think this is?

%%% SECTION: Numerical Solutions Using a Discrete Grid
%%%
%%%

\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Numerical Solutions using a Discrete Grid}

\noindent
For many applications, the use of simple conjugate priors is not
appropriate, and we need to deal with the posterior integral
calculation itself. Since analytical solutions do not exist, we use
numerical techniques to approximate the integral.

The supplied functions \texttt{calculate.\-data.\-probability()} and
\texttt{calculate.\-posterior.\-probability()} perform these
calculations. The major benefit of this approach is that we can now
use arbitrary priors.


\worksheetexercise Using the \texttt{cointoss10} data, and a
$\text{Beta}(1,1)$ prior, use the grid approximation to the integral
to calculate the posterior density. Compare the output of this to the
analytical solution.


\worksheetexercise Repeat the previous exercise of comparing the
influence of priors on the posterior density for both the 10 coin toss
and 1,000 coin toss data. Match this output to the analytics solutions
you derived earlier.


\worksheetexercise Suppose we think the coin has a 3/1 bias, but we do
not know for which side. Create a prior that represents this and
investigate the posterior for both sets of data.


\worksheetexercise Estimate the posterior density for the bias in the
coin assuming you have an equally weighted prior belief of the coin
being fair, or biased 3/1 for either side.


\worksheetexercise Investigate the influence of the size of the
dataset on the posterior for arbitrary priors.

%%% SECTION: Introducing Hierarchical Models
%%%
%%%

\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Introducing Hierarchical Models}

\noindent
We can now extend this idea by using a hierarchical model. Previously,
we were considering the coin by itself, and the goal was to estimate
the parameters of the model. We could extend that model by using
multiple coins, but our initial intuition would be to treat multiple
coins as being independent of one another.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{hierarchical_singlemint_singlecoin.png}
\caption{\label{fig1}
Graphical Representation of the Single Mint, Single Coin
Hierarchical model}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\worksheetbreak
However, what if we were instead to also consider the fact that a coin
is minted, and the bias of the coin is probably influenced by the
manufacturing processes and quality of its origin. In this case, we
could incorporate prior beliefs about the mint as well the coin, and
then use our data to update those beliefs.

\worksheetbreak
To start with, we will work from a single coin coming from a single
mint. Each coin is produced with a bias of $\theta$, but these are
also random variables drawn from another Beta distribution with mean
$\mu$. This means that outcomes of the coin tosses, $y$, are the
result of a hierarchical random process. At the top, we have a
distribution for $\mu$, and we call this the
\emph{hyperdistribution}. Accordingly, $\mu$ is a
\emph{hyperparameter}. We then use the values of the hyperparameters
as inputs to the distribution for $theta$. In turn, with the values of
$\theta$, we then determine values for the data, $y$. A graphical
representation of this model is shown in Figure \ref{fig1}.

\worksheetbreak
So, the hyperparameter $\mu$ is used to determine values $A_\mu$, and
$B_\mu$ for the hyper-beta-distribution. To do this, we also need a
value $K$, which for the moment we will assume is a constant, and is a
representation of how closely the value of $\theta$ depends on
$\mu$. For high values of $K$, $\theta$ will cluster tightly around
$\mu$.

\worksheetbreak
Expressing this formally, we have

\[ p(y|\theta) = \theta^y (1 - \theta)^{(1-y)} , \]

\noindent
just like before, but we now also have $\theta$ as a random variate,

\[ p(\theta | \mu) = B(\theta \, | \, \mu K, \, (1 - \mu) K) \]

\noindent
with $\mu$ itself being drawn from a hyperdistribution (in this case, the
beta distribution):

\[ \mu \backsim B(A_\mu, B_\mu). \]

\worksheetbreak
Note that this model will required values for $A_\mu$ and $B_\mu$, and
these will reflect our prior beliefs about the mint. For this, we will
probably just use low constant values, representing weak prior beliefs
on the mint itself.

\worksheetbreak
So, the above seems like a very interesting approach, but how do we go
about implementing the approach? It is unlikely that an analytic
solution would be either tractable or practical, but like the drunk
looking for his keys, this is where the light is.

\worksheetbreak
So, we know from Bayes' Rule that

\[ p(\theta, \mu | y) = \frac{p(y | \theta, \mu) p(\theta, \mu)}{p(y)}. \]

\noindent
From our model, we can see that, conditional on $\theta$, the
likelihood model does not depend on $\mu$, and so we have

\[ p(y | \, \theta, \mu) = p(y | \theta). \]

\noindent
Also, from another application of Bayes' Rule,

\[ p(\theta | \mu) = \frac{p(\theta, \mu)}{p(\mu)} \implies
p(\theta, \mu) = p(\theta | \mu) \, p(\mu) \],

\noindent
resulting in the following expression for the posterior distribution

\[ p(\mu, \theta \, | \, y) = \frac{p(y | \theta) \, p(\theta | \mu) \, p(\mu)}{p(y)} \]

\worksheetbreak
So, if we create a grid for both $\theta$ and $\mu$, we can
approximate the posterior from numerical integration. We take our
models for $p(y|\theta)$, $p(\theta|\mu)$ and $p(\mu)$, and create our
posterior by integration.



\worksheetexercise Use a very weak prior for $\mu$, but a value of 5
for $K$, and generate the posterior density for this model using the
\texttt{cointoss10} data. You can use the supplied function
\texttt{calculate.\-hierarchical.\-posterior()} to do this. How would you
visualise this output in a meaningful way?

\worksheetexercise How does the data affect the posterior distribution
for $\mu$ and $\theta$?

\worksheetexercise Repeat the above exercise but with a $K$ value of
100. Do you notice a difference in the posterior distributions of
$\mu$ and $\theta$?

\worksheetexercise Repeat the above for $K = 1,000$. How are the
posterior densities affected now?

\worksheetexercise Repeat all of the above using the
\texttt{cointoss1000} data.

\worksheetexercise What impact does the size of the dataset have on
the various posterior densities?

%%% SECTION: Introducing Sampling for Hierarchical Models
%%%
%%%

\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Hierarchical
  Models}

\noindent
It should be quickly apparent that using the discrete grid approach to
approximating these posterior densities will not be feasible
computationally once we start adding more than two or three parameters
over anything more than 100 to 1000 discrete steps in each
dimension. The grids become very large very quickly, and even the
incredible improvements in computational power have not been able to
keep up.

\worksheetbreak
Instead, we use a technique known as Markov-Chain Monte Carlo to
sample from the posterior distribution. For this we use Stan, a
generic MCMC sampler that uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which has
benefits over Gibbs sampling. Stan has largely superseded the older
BUGS and JAGS software in the last few years. To use Stan with R, we
need access to a C++ compiler and the package \texttt{rstan}.

\worksheetbreak
There are a few steps involved in setting up the sampler, the first of
which involves specifying the model used by Stan. Stan has its own
language for doing this, and is often written into its own file. For
our first model, the single-mint-single-coin model is provided in file
\texttt{singlemint\_\-singlecoin.stan}.


\worksheetexercise Using the data in \texttt{cointoss10.rds}, set up
the model in \texttt{rstan} and run the samples. What inferences can
be made on $\mu$ from this model? Think about why this is the case.

\worksheetexercise Repeat all the exercises from the equivalent grid
approximation of this model, this time using \texttt{rstan} code to
produce your distributions.

\worksheetexercise Compare the prior and posterior distributions for
$\theta$.

\worksheetexercise The above exercises involve changing some of the
prior values. Could we redo the model to make it more efficient to
change these priors?

\worksheetexercise Discuss the validity of treating this scenario as a
hierarchical model. What does $\mu$ represent in this case?


\worksheetbreak
We now have all the tools we need to build hierarchical models, so let
us extend the above scenario in more interesting ways. What if we have
multiple coins minted from the same mint? What types of inferential
models can be built from this set up?

\worksheetbreak
The Stan model for a single mint, multiple coin model is supplied in
the file \texttt{singlemint\_\-multiplecoin.stan}. Open the file and
make sure you understand the model. Data for multiple coin tosses with
two different coins is given in the file
\texttt{singlemint\_\-twocoin.rds}. This is a data.table with three
columns denoting the id of the coin, the number of trials and the
number of successes.


\worksheetexercise Create a prior and posterior sample for the above
scenario. What kind of methods can we use to visualise this data? Note
that these hierarchical models quickly prove problematic in terms of
visualisation, so this is a real issue.

\worksheetexercise Investigate how different values for $K$ change the
inferences. Check the differences in how the data influences the
posterior distribution for any given prior.

\worksheetexercise Think about how you would extend this model to
tosses of three coins, and then five coins? How feasible is it to
analyse data from the tosses of twenty coins?



%%%
%%%
%%% SECTION: Expanding Hierarchical Models
%%%
%%%

\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Expanding Hierarchical Models}

\noindent
The true power of the Bayesian approach is that you can encapsulate
any and all uncertainty in your modelling via your priors. Previously,
we did have one parameter that we were `guessing' at the value of,
$K$, which controls the strength of the dependency of the coin mint
bias $\mu$ on the bias of any individual coin, $\theta$. For higher
values of $K$, the values of $\theta$ are more closely clustered
around the $\mu$ value for the mint.

\worksheetbreak
To illustrate the influence of this value, we were running our sampler
with different values of $K$. However, in reality, we give this value
a prior distribution and allow the data to perform some inference on
this value as well. The distribution we use for this one is the
\emph{Gamma distribution}, which is a common distribution for values
$x \geq 0$.

\worksheetbreak
This distribution is closely related to the \emph{Gamma function},
$\Gamma(s) = \int^\infty_0 dt \, t^{s-1} e^{-t}$, a generalisation for
factorials.

\worksheetbreak
The Gamma distribution has two parameters controlling it, the
\emph{rate} and the \emph{shape}, and we set both these values so that
our prior is broad across the possible values for $\kappa$.


\worksheetexercise The Stan file for the fully Bayesian model is in
\texttt{singlemint\_\-full.stan}. Using the model specified in this
file with the data contained in \texttt{singlemint\_\-twocoin.rds} to
sample from the prior and posterior distributions.

\worksheetexercise How does using a fully Bayesian model change the
inferences we make on the parameters of the model based on the data?

\worksheetexercise Create a new dataset for five coins with different
counts of coin tosses for each coin. Using different values of
$\theta$ for each coin, but have them be relatively similar.

\worksheetexercise Run the fully Bayesian model on your data. Make
inferences on the posterior distribution. How do these inferences
match up with the knowledge you already have from generating the data.

\worksheetexercise Create another dataset for the five coins. The
dataset should be similar to the previous one, but this time use very
different values for $\theta$.

\worksheetexercise Run the model with the new data. How do your
inferences change between the two datasets, and does this make sense
in light of how the data was generated?

\worksheetexercise Use the supplied function The accompanying code
file contain the function
\texttt{generate.\-hierarchical.\-coin.\-data()}. This function will
generate coin toss data for coins generated from a mint with $\mu$ and
$\kappa$, and for a varying number of coins and total coin tosses. Use
this function to generate coin toss data for for 5 coins and 50 tosses
and then for 50 coins and 5 tosses. The code has been vectorised, so
make sure you understand how it works.

\worksheetexercise Use the full Bayesian model with both datasets to
generate the posterior distributions for the various parameters
associated with both datasets. Examine the posterior distributions to
decide which dataset is better for making inferences on the mean value
of the mint $\mu$. Does your answer make sense? What conclusions can
we draw about the tradeoff between the number of coins versus the
number tosses per coin in this case? How do you think this can be
generalised?

%%% SECTION: Expanding the Hierarchy: Multiple Mints
%%%
%%%

\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Expanding the Hierarchy: Multiple Mints}

\noindent
While the methods employed in the previous section work fine, a more
`Bayesian' approach would be to incorporate the mint data into the
model, rather than running a separate run for each mint. As you
imagine, this is especially true if there are a large number of
separate entities at the highest hierarchy of the model.

\worksheetbreak
Incorporating the mint data for each coin is relatively simple --- we
just need to index by $\mu$ and $\kappa$ for each mint, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig2}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[height=10cm]{hierarchical_multiplemint_multiplecoin.png}
\caption{\label{fig2}
Graphical Representation of the Multiple Mint, Multiple Coin Hierarchical
model}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\worksheetbreak
For the purposes of estimating and inferring on mint-quality, we are
looking for coins that are as fair as possible i.e. have a $\theta$ as
close to $0.50$ as possible, and can do so as consistently as
possible, i.e. the variance of the $\theta$ values for the coins is as
low as possible.


\worksheetexercise Generate data using the supplied funtion
\texttt{generate.multiple.mint.data} for 5 mints. You can choose your
own input parameters or work with the supplied defaults.

\worksheetexercise Use simple density estimation and summary
statistics to get a quick estimate of the quality of the mints.

\worksheetexercise Use the supplied multiple mint Stan model to get
estimates for the various $\mu$ and $K$ for each mint.

\worksheetexercise Rerun the sampler, but now use the file in
\texttt{multiplemint\_lognormal\_k.stan}, which puts a lognormal prior
on the value of $K$. Compare the output to the previous model that
uses a Gamma prior for $K$.

\worksheetexercise Make a larger dataset, using more coins per mint
and more tosses per coin, and rerun the samplers with this data. How
does it affect the inferences?

\worksheetexercise Vary both the number of coins per mint and the
number of tosses per coin to determine which has the biggest effect on
inference on $K$.

%%%

\pagebreak
\worksheetsection{Posterior Predictive Checks}

\noindent
Posterior predictive checks (PPCs) are a way to use the output of the
sampler to generate 'fake' data from your sample. You then compare the
fake data to the original data and assess what aspects of the data are
not being captured by the model.

\worksheetbreak
It is probably no surprise that the use of PPCs is quite an art, and
involves thinking carefully about what you are doing. Ask very high
level questions about your problem and then see if there is a way to
quantify that question. You then compare quantities from your data to
the generated quantities produced by the Stan model.

\worksheetexercise Using our hierarchical mint model, what quantities
might help us assess the quality of the mint? Think about ways in
which we might encapsulate that in the data?

\worksheetexercise Using the \texttt{generated quantities} block in
Stan, use our latest model to generate samples of this value from our
data. Compare the distribution of this generated quantity to that from
our data.

\worksheetexercise What can you infer from making this comparison?

\worksheetexercise What other quantities can we think about to help us
assess our current model?
