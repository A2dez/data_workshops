All code and data for this workshop is available at the following URL:

https://github.com/kaybenleroll/data_workshops

Code is available in the `ws_pgm_202009/` directory.



Content in this workshop is based on the book
[Probabalistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461422983)
by Soren Hojsgaard.

Also look at the vignettes for the packages
[`gRain`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gRain/index.html)
and
[`gRbase`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gRbase/index.html)


Remember that this topic is massive. I could easily give a full
semester course on this stuff to really do it justice, so most of this
workshop is just me working through the material as I learn it.


As a result, it is highly likely this worksheet and code contains
typos, errors, logical flaws and other mistakes in need of correction
in this workshop, so if you note any, please let me know so I can try
to fix them!


If you want to look into this topic more, there is an old Coursera
course by Daphne Koller (tough going but excellent):

https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models



This course was based on her textbook

[Probabalistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques](http://pgm.stanford.edu/)
