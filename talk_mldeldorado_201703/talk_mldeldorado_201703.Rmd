# The El Dorado Competition

## Basic Idea

Bid for mining rights

\

Extraction Costs

\

\[
\text{Score} = \text{Start} - \text{Bids Paid} + \text{Sales} - \text{Extraction Costs}
\]

\

Richest person wins

---

## Design Goals

Emphasise Prediction Use

Prediction Accuracy Less Important

Something for everyone


## Game Design





# Logistics

## Generating Data


## Managing Submissions



# Results
