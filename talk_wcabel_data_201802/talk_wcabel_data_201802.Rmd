# What is (Big) Data?


## Dirty Little Secret

\


You (Probably) Do Not Have a Big Data Problem




## Sizes of Data

\

Hadley Wickham

---

### Three Data Sizes

\

In-Memory

\

On-Disk

\

Multi-Disk



## Three Problem Sizes

\

Sampleable Problems

\

Parallelisable Problems

\

Irreducible Problems

---

### Sampleable Problems

\

$\sim$ 90% of problems

\


---

### Parallelisable Problems

\

$\sim$ 9% of problems

\



---

### Irreducible Problems

\

$\sim$ 1% of problems



# What Does Big Data Mean?





# Data in Insurance

---

Most classic insurance problems are small data


## Actuarial Problems

\

Pricing

\

Reserving

\

Capital Modelling


---

### Loss-Costing DNF Business

\

5-10k Policies

\

SoV data can be large

\

Claim data poor quality


---

### Estimating Claims Reserves


---

### ICT Pricing

\

Data censored


---

### Cost of Guarantees

\

With-profit Funds

\

Quant finance

\

MonteCarlo simulation


---

### Estimating Lapse Risk

\

Customer segmentation

\

Survival analysis
